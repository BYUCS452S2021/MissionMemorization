Please Consider Joining My Team: [Mission Memorize](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16eae4M3wie8OWqitwOnH6zMvAr0P9lTOFWCDjdwaKy0/edit?usp=sharing)

While there are already several services meant to aid in scripture memorization, many of these services require unnecessary amounts of time to set up and get going.  Similarly, it can be quite time consuming to copy down passages by hand.  Oftentimes, missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints would like to dedicate time have limited amounts of time to dedicate to create and manage scripture memorization plans.  It can be extremely time consuming to rewrite scriptures.

We will be creating a free scripture memorization website meant to help missionaries for and other users quickly save, manage, and print scriptures from the four standard works of the Church.  We will implement a database which contains scripture verses to pull data from.  We will also allow for short hand references, searching, and mass importing lists to make the process of finding and saving passages quicker. We will also implement a system for keeping track of progress which is not time consuming.
