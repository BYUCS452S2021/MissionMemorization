# Mission Memorize

### Make Memorizing Scriptures Easier!

##### Project description

While there are already several services meant to aid in scripture memorization, many of these services require unnecessary amounts of time to set up and get going.  Similarly, it can be quite time consuming to copy down passages by hand.  Oftentimes, missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints would like to dedicate time have limited amounts of time to dedicate to create and manage scripture memorization plans.  It can be extremely time consuming to rewrite scriptures.

We will be creating a free scripture memorization website meant to help missionaries for and other users quickly save, manage, and print scriptures from the four standard works of the Church.  We will implement a database which contains scripture verses to pull data from.  We will also allow for short hand references, searching, and mass importing lists to make the process of finding and saving passages quicker. We will also implement a system for keeping track of progress which is not time consuming.

##### Team
I'm looking for one or two others to join the implementation team.

##### Implementation
We plan to implement the MVP using an SQL, then migrate to NoSQL.

##### SQL
Not sure which relational database to use. Suggestions welcome!

##### No-SQL
We are leaning towards using a key-value database once the nonprofit becomes so popular that it outgrows SQL databases.

### BOLTS
Here are our expectations.

##### Business
At no charge, anyone may use the service to create a profile, save and manage scriptures being memorized and download formatted pdf files that can be printed and used during the week.  A weekly reporting mechanism will also be available to track progress of memorization.
We could also look into providing paid printing and lamination services to users as our clientbase grows.

We plan to quickly implement a "minimum viable product" prototype, and then seek donations and a government startup grant to go into production and distribution.

##### Operation
The founders will operate the application until it becomes more successful, at which time we will hire a staff, led by a Chief Operating Officer (COO) to ensure value to our customers.  The nonprofit will then look for more ways to use technology to further missionary work.

##### Legal
The business will be a Utah Nonprofit, or 501(c)(3), corporation.  Any potential revenue from paid services, partnerships, or ad space would be donated to the [General Missionary Fund](https://philanthropies.churchofjesuschrist.org/missionary)


##### Technical
Our priorities will be:
1. Choose and reserve a domain name to house the website.
2. Choose an initial SQL database for a prototype
3. Choose both client-side and server-side programming languages
4. Implement the MVP


##### Social
We will gain customers initially through advertising.  As we grow, we will look to partner with the Missionary Training Center and the Church Missionary Department.
