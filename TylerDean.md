Hello Grant,

I am interested in your application and would like to be part of the implementation team.  I love the idea of it being open source and non-profit and I too consider it a great way to give back to the missionary program.  Thanks to my current job I have some experience with both back and front-end, though the majority of my strengths would be in front-end development.

I'm not too familiar with the existing scripture memorization services you had mentioned.  I would appreciate if you could point me to what those services are so I can study them in detail and see how your plans would be an improvement over what is currently being offered.

I am intrigued by the notion of purchasing advertising space for the intial stages of the application.  Would this just be an out of pocket expense since all revenue from ad space will go to the General Missionary Fund?

I look forward to be able to discuss further our first steps on the technical side of things.

Thank you,
Tyler Dean
